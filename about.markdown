I am a ham radio operator (PU4THZ) and researcher interested in RF design focused on microwaves / mm-wave transceivers, SDR based radios, DSP programming with Python, C++ and PipelineC for FPGA's. I also have experience with GnuRadio, analog electronics and antenna design. I'm currently in a university cubesat design & competition team (NoizOrbita) working as the TT&C (Telemetry & Telecommand) and Payload System Engineer and doing a research project developing one robust TT&C system for cubesats at CNPQ.

I'm a collaborator of the open source digital radio [M17 Project](https://github.com/M17-Project) and I've contribuited to the SDR software [SdrAngel](https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel) making the M17 demodulator build work with MSVC. I'm mostly a Windows user so as a hobby / side project I like to port / fix C++ open source projects for windows. Another hobby is doing 3D Graphics and writing Raytracers for fun.

I have more than 3 years experience with C++, about 3 years with Python and 2 years with GnuRadio. As my main 3D software I've used Autodesk 3DS Max for about 4 years and Sketchup for around 6 years. I'm currently "retired" for 3D work but I occasionally do some work for friends and some old clients.
