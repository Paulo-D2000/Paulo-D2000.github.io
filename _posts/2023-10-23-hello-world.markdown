Hello visitor! This is the first (of many, hopefully) posts. On this blog I will talk about SDR (Software Defined Radio), C++ and Python Programming, DSP (Digital Signal Processing), FPGA development with PipelineC and many more things!

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Bye! See you on the next post...
